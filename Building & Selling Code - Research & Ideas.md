# Building & Selling Code - Research & Ideas
*Compiled Feb 9, 2026*

## The Big Picture

You + AI coding tools = ability to build and ship fast. The question is: what do people actually pay for?

Two paths:
1. **Freelance/Client work** — guaranteed pay, project by project ($500-$1000 per project)
2. **Micro SaaS / Products** — slower start but recurring passive income ($20-$100/mo per customer)

## Where to Find What People Want

### Reddit (Goldmine)
- **r/SaaS** — people literally post "I'd pay for X"
- **r/smallbusiness** — business owners venting about tools that suck
- **r/Entrepreneur** — idea validation threads
- Search any subreddit for **"I wish there was"** or **"I'd pay for"**

### Twitter/X
- Search **"someone should build"** or **"I'd pay for an app that"**
- Follow indie hackers: @levelsio, @marclouv, @dannypostmaa

### Dedicated Platforms
- **IndieHackers.com** — community sharing what's working + revenue numbers
- **Acquire.com** — see what people are buying/selling (shows what has value)
- **MicroConf Connect** — community of small SaaS founders
- **microsaasidea.com** — curated micro SaaS ideas with competitor research

### Where People Are Paying Right Now
- **Fiverr/Upwork** — browse what people are hiring for. If 500 people are paying $50 for the same thing, that's a $500 tool waiting to be built
- **Gumroad/LemonSqueezy** — see what digital products sell well
- **Product Hunt** — what's launching and getting traction

### Pain Point Mining
- **G2/Capterra reviews** — read 1-2 star reviews of popular software. Every complaint is a product idea
- **Facebook Groups** — niche business groups are full of "does anyone know a tool that..."

## The Winning Pattern

**Find a boring niche → Find the one thing they hate doing manually → Build a simple tool that fixes it**

Best advice from r/SaaS:
> "Go ask your dentist what software they hate. Find a business using Excel to manage something complex. Build a SaaS that replaces that spreadsheet. Charge $100/mo. You only need 80 customers for six figures."

### The Formula
1. **Find pain in a weird pond** — Facebook groups, subreddits, niche Discords
2. **Slice the niche thinner** — not "project management for dentists" but "project management for orthodontists who do Invisalign only"
3. **Validate fast** — mock 3 screenshots, cold-email 20 target users, ask for $50 lifetime deal prepaid. If 5 pay, you have an MVP worth building
4. **Build ugly, ship fast** — 1 feature that removes 1 burning pain. Nothing more
5. **Price like a painkiller, not a vitamin** — $19/mo is a vitamin, $79/mo is a painkiller

## Quick-Start Ideas We Could Build Together

### Freelance/Client Work (Guaranteed $500-$1000 per project)
- **Custom AI chatbots** for local businesses (templatize the backend, customize per client)
- **Business websites/landing pages** with AI-generated content
- **Automation packages** — set up email sequences, lead follow-up, review management
- **Data processing scripts** — Python automation for businesses stuck in spreadsheet hell

### Product Ideas (Build Once, Sell Repeatedly)
- **Chrome Extension** — find a workflow people do manually in the browser, automate it
- **Shopify App** — find a gap in the app store, build a focused plugin
- **AI Wrapper Tool** — take an AI API, build a clean UI for a specific use case (resume builder, proposal generator, listing description writer)
- **Niche Scheduling/Booking Tool** — pick an underserved industry (groomers, tutors, cleaners)
- **Review Management Tool** — monitors Google reviews, drafts responses, owner approves with one click

### The SaaS Flipping Play
- Buy struggling SaaS on **Acquire.com**, fix it up with AI coding, resell or grow it
- Like house flipping but for software

## Key Numbers

- Average time to first dollar for micro SaaS: **38 days**
- You need $0-$500 to start (Stripe + free-tier hosting)
- 40% of successful micro SaaS launched on **no-code** stacks
- When to go full-time: MRR = **1.5x monthly living expenses**
- 80 customers × $100/mo = **six figures**

## Next Steps

1. Pick a direction: freelance clients OR build a product
2. If freelance: set up Upwork profile, start bidding
3. If product: pick a niche, spend 2-3 days researching pain points
4. Validate before building — don't spend a month coding something nobody wants
5. Ship ugly, iterate based on feedback
